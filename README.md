# Streamlit-App

In this project you can found a new way to present data science analysis to your collegues. 
I am using **Streamlit** with **Python** * to deal with different datasets and to have the choice to build multiple maching learning models by manipulating certain parameters.



You need to install streamlit to be able to lunch this app.

You can have the same result by typing the following command: 
$ streamlit run app.py
